# ðŸ›¤ My DSA Journey in C++

Welcome to my **Data Structures & Algorithms Journey** ðŸš€  
This repository documents my **day-by-day progress**, challenges, and learnings as I work towards mastering problem-solving and preparing for FAANG-level coding interviews.

## ðŸŽ¯ Why This Journey?

In August 2025, I committed to **starting my DSA journey from scratch** â€” no shortcuts, no skipping fundamentals.  
This repo is my **accountability tracker**, my **learning journal**, and a place where I can look back to see how far I've come.
